# Local Landing Page

Working on different web project from the same machine is a pain without virtual hosts.

Virtual hosts is great but I like to have visually the choice on what I want to work depending on my mood.

This local landing page has been created in order to display all my current web project and redirect me into it.

Getting started:

-Create a route to this repo index.html

-Add your own serverName and img in this template.
