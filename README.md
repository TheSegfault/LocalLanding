# Local Landing Page

Working on many web projects from the same machine is a pain when using localhost without virtual hosts.

Virtual hosts is great but I like to have visually the choice on what I want to work depending on my mood.

This local landing page has been created in order to display all my current web project and redirect me into it.

This landing page is also useful to show my work easily. (Without domain)

Getting started:

    -Create a local route to this repo index.html
    -Replace with your own urls and img.
    -Restart your local server.
